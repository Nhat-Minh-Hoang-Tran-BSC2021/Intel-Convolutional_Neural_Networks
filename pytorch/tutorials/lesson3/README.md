# Convolutional Layers in PyTorch

To create a convolutional layer in PyTorch, you must first import the necessary module:

```python
import torch.nn as nn
```

Then, there is a two part process to defining a convolutional layer and defining the feedforward behavior of a model (how an input moves through the layers of a network). First, you must define a Model class and fill in two functions.

### init

You can define a convolutional layer in the `__init__` function of by using the following format:

```python
self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(in_channels, out_channels, kernel_size, stride=1, padding=0)
```

### forward

Then, you refer to that layer in the forward function! Here, I am passing in an input image `x` and applying a ReLU function to the output of this layer.

```python
x = F.relu(self.conv1(x))
```

### Arguments

- `in_channels` - The number of inputs (in depth), 3 for an RGB image, for example.

- `out_channels` - The number of output channels, i.e. the number of filtered "images" a convolutional layer is made of or the number of unique, convolutional kernels that will be applied to an input.

- `kernel_size` - Number specifying both the height and width of the (square) convolutional kernel.

There are some additional, optional arguments that you might like to tune:

- `stride` - The stride of the convolution. If you don't specify anything, `stride` is set to `1`.

- `padding` - The border of 0's around an input array. If you don't specify `anything`, padding is set to `0`.

**NOTE**: It is possible to represent both `kernel_size` and `stride` as either a number or a tuple.

There are many other tunable arguments that you can set to change the behavior of your convolutional layers. To read more about these, we recommend perusing the [official documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#conv2d).

## Pooling Layers

Pooling layers take in a kernel_size and a stride. Typically the same value as is the down-sampling factor. For example, the following code will down-sample an input's x-y dimensions, by a factor of 2:

```python
self.pool = nn.MaxPool2d(2,2)
```

### forward

Here, we see that poling layer being applied in the forward function.

```python
x = F.relu(self.conv1(x))
x = self.pool(x)
```

### Convolutional Example

Say I'd like the next layer in my CNN to be a convolutional layer that takes the layer constructed in Example 1 as input. Say I'd like my new layer to have 32 filters, each with a height and width of 3. When performing the convolution, I'd like the filter to jump 1 pixel at a time. I want this layer to have the same width and height as the input layer, and so I will pad accordingly. Then, to construct this convolutional layer, I would use the following line of code:

```python
self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(16, 32, 3, padding=1)
```

## Sequential Models

We can also create a CNN in PyTorch by using a `Sequential` wrapper in the `__init__` function. Sequential allows us to stack different types of layers, specifying activation functions in between!

```python
def __init__(self):
        super(ModelName, self).__init__()
        self.features = nn.Sequential(
              nn.Conv2d(1, 16, 2, stride=2),
              nn.MaxPool2d(2, 2),
              nn.ReLU(True),

              nn.Conv2d(16, 32, 3, padding=1),
              nn.MaxPool2d(2, 2),
              nn.ReLU(True) 
        )
```

## Formula: Number of Parameters in a Convolutional Layer

The number of parameters in a convolutional layer depends on the supplied values of `filters/out_channels`, `kernel_size`, and `input_shape`. Let's define a few variables:

- `K` - the number of filters in the convolutional layer

- `F` - the height and width of the convolutional filters

- `D_in` - the depth of the previous layer

Notice that `K = out_channels`, and `F = kernel_size`. Likewise, `D_in` is the last value in the `input_shape` tuple, typically 1 or 3 (RGB and grayscale, respectively).

## Formula: Shape of a Convolutional Layer

The shape of a convolutional layer depends on the supplied values of `kernel_size`, `input_shape`, `padding`, and `stride`. Let's define a few variables:

- `K` - the number of filters in the convolutional layer

- `F` - the height and width of the convolutional filters

- `S` - the stride of the convolution

- `P` - the padding

- `W_in` - the width/height (square) of the previous layer

Notice that `K = out_channels`, `F = kernel_size`, and `S = stride`. Likewise, `W_in` is the first and second value of the input_shape tuple.

The **depth** of the convolutional layer will always equal the number of filters `K`.

The spatial dimensions of a convolutional layer can be calculated as: `(W_inâˆ’F+2P)/S+1`

## Flattening

Part of completing a CNN architecture, is to *flatten* the eventual output of a series of convolutional and pooling layers, so that `all` parameters can be seen (as a vector) by a linear classification layer. At this step, it is imperative that you know exactly how many parameters are output by a layer.

For the following quiz questions, consider an input image that is `130x130 (x, y) and 3` in depth (RGB). Say, this image goes through the following layers in order:

```python
nn.Conv2d(3, 10, 3)
nn.MaxPool2d(4, 4)
nn.Conv2d(10, 20, 5, padding=2)
nn.MaxPool2d(2, 2)
```
