# Deep Learning with PyTorch

## Course overview

Deep learning is a field of machine learning utilizing massive neural networks, massive datasets, and accelerated computing on GPUs.
Many of the advancements we've seen in AI recently are due to the power of deep learning.
This revolution is impacting a wide range of industries already with applications such as personal voice assistants, medical imaging, automated vehicles, video game AI, and more.

In this course, I'll be covering the concepts behind deep learning and how to build deep learning models using PyTorch.
I've included a lot of hands-on exercises so by the end of the course, you'll be defining and training your own state-of-the-art deep learning models.
