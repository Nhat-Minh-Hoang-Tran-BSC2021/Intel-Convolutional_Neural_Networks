# Deep Learning Research

The goal of this repository is to provide comprehensive tutorials and experiments for TensorFlow and PyTorch while maintaining the simplicity of the code.

## Prerequisites

It is assumed that you have some Python programming experience and that you are familiar with Python’s main scientific libraries—in particular, [NumPy](https://numpy.org/), [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), and [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/).

Also, if you care about what’s under the hood, you should have a reasonable understanding of college-level math as well (calculus, linear algebra, probabilities, and statistics).

If you don’t know Python yet, http://learnpython.org/ is a great place to start. The official tutorial on Python.org is also quite good.
