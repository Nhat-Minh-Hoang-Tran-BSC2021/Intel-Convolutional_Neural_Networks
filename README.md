[TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. It has a comprehensive, flexible ecosystem of [tools](https://www.tensorflow.org/resources/tools), [libraries](https://www.tensorflow.org/resources/libraries-extensions), and [community](https://www.tensorflow.org/community) resources that lets researchers push the state-of-the-art in ML and developers easily build and deploy ML-powered applications.
