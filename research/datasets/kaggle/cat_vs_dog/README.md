# Dogs vs. Cats Challenge

In this competition, you'll write an algorithm to classify whether images contain either a dog or a cat.  This is easy for humans, dogs, and cats. Your computer will find it a bit more difficult.

## The Asirra data set

Asirra (Animal Species Image Recognition for Restricting Access) is a HIP that works by asking users to identify photographs of cats and dogs. This task is difficult for computers, but studies have shown that people can accomplish it quickly and accurately. Many even think it's fun! Here is an example of the Asirra interface:

Asirra is unique because of its partnership with [Petfinder.com](http://www.petfinder.com/), the world's largest site devoted to finding homes for homeless pets. They've provided Microsoft Research with over three million images of cats and dogs, manually classified by people at thousands of animal shelters across the United States. Kaggle is fortunate to offer a subset of this data for fun and research.

## Dataset desciption

The training archive contains 25,000 images of dogs and cats. Train your algorithm on these files and predict the labels for test1.zip (1 = dog, 0 = cat).
