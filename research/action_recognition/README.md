## C3D

C3D is a modified version of BVLC caffe to support 3D convolution and pooling. The main supporting features include:

- Training or fine-tuning 3D ConvNets.
- Extracting video features with pre-trained C3D models.

For more information about C3D, please refer to the [C3D project website](http://vlg.cs.dartmouth.edu/c3d).
